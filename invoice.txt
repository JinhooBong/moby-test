                    NARRATOR
          This belief stemmed from early
          exposure to sad British pop music
          and a total misreading of the
          movie, “The Graduate.”

INT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY

The girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones
in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost
like a boy’s but her face is feminine and pretty enough to
get away with it.
                    NARRATOR
          The girl, Summer Finn of
          Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share
          this belief.

INT BATHROOM - 1994

Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair
extends down to her lower back.

                    NARRATOR
          Since the -DEMO- of her
          parents’ marriage, she’d only loved
          two things. The first was her long
          blonde hair.

She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.

                    NARRATOR
          The second was how easily she could
          cut it off... And feel nothing.

SPLITSCREEN. INT BOARDROOM/ INT CUBICLE - SAME

On the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to
some boring presentation. On the left, Summer answers a call,
takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long
narrow hallway.
