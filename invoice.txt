                                                            6.



                      GIRL
          Thomas.

Tom freezes.

                    TOM
          Rachel? What are you doing here?

                    GIRL (RACHEL)
          I’m here to help you.

                    TOM
          Help me how?

                    RACHEL
          First, put down the plate.
Tom slowly obliges.

                    RACHEL
          Now come here and sit down.

Tom sits next to the young girl. Paul and Mckenzie sit on
either side of them.

                    RACHEL
          The key is not to panic.

                    TOM
          I think I’m gonna be sick.

                    RACHEL
          Drink this.

She hands him a glass of water. Tom drinks it down.

                    MCKENZIE
          What is that?

                      RACHEL
          Vodka.

                    TOM
              (grimacing at the -DEMO-)
          More.

He gulps another down.

                    TOM
          Does Mom know you’re here? It’s
          gotta be past 10.
